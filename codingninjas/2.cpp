// Although Star-Lord considers himself legendary outlaw , his capabilities are not seen with high regards by other people . To redeem himself he needs to find a special integer
// ‘n’ which satisfies the following condition : (n|a) = n + a.
   // Here ‘|’ represents binary OR operator
   // ‘a’ is an even integer .
// Help Star-Lord find such integer .
// If there are multiple such integers, output any. It can be shown that such an integer always exists under the given constraints.

// Input Format :
 // The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100)  — the number of test cases.
 // The first and only line of each test case contains one integer ‘a’(2≤a≤10^9) which is even.

// Output Format :
 // For each test case, print a single integer n (1≤n≤10^9) that satisfies the condition mentioned in the statement. If there are multiple such integers, output any. 
 //It can be shown that such an integer always exists under the given constraints.

// Sample Input 1 :
// 3
// 2
// 114
// 2016

// Sample Output 1 :
// 12
// 8
// 2
