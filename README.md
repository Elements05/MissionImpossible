<h2>Welcome Competitive programmers.......</h2>
 
 <h3> This repo is available for hacktober fest 2022</h3>
This is a repo where you can submit/find solutions of various competitive programming questions solved mostly in cpp but all programming languages are welcome. The folders which are used in the repo are:
 - CodeChef
 - LeetCode
 - Random (special)

In the CodeChef folder, the solutions of CodeChef questions are stored with their <i>problem code</i> as name of the file. Contributors are supposed to find solutions to questions in CodeChef platform and create a PR with <b>problem_code.language_used</b> as the name.

In the LeetCode folder, the solutions of LeetCode questions are stored with their <i>problem name</i> as name of the file. Contributors are supposed to find solutions to questions in LeetCode platform and create a PR with <b>problem_name.language_used</b> as the name.

The specials are a bit different:
- In Random folder, simple coding questions are given. The contributors have to find the solutions to the questions by creating a <b><i>sol <question_number>.language_used </b></i> and create a PR to that folder.
