# MissionImpossible
 
<h1>Welcome Competitive programmers!!!!!!!!!!</h1>
 
This is a repo where you can submit/find solutions of various competitive programming questions solved mostly in cpp but all programming languages are welcome. The folders which are used in the repo are:
 - CodeChef
 - HackerRank
 - Google Kick Start
 - LAB (special)
 - Random (special)

In the CodeChef folder, the solutions are stored with their problem code as name of the file. If you want to contribute in that folder, keep the file name as
<b><i>problem code.language used</b></i> and create a PR.

In the HackerRank folder, the solutions are stored questions as comments to most files (some of the solutions don't have questions). If you want to contribute in that folder, comment the question in the solution file and create a PR.

In the Google Kick Start folder, the solutions of only 1 round is present. If you want to contribute in that folder, comment the question in the solution file and create a PR.

The specials are a bit different:
- In LAB folder, simple C questions are solved. The contributors have to find the question to these solutions by creating a <b><i>README <question_number>.md</b></i> and create a PR to that folder.
- In Random folder, simple C questions are solved. The contributors have to find the solutions to the questions by creating a <b><i>sol <question_number>.language_used </b></i> and create a PR to that folder.
  
For any further queries/suggestions, create an issue....
